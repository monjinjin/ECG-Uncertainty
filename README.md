# ECG-Uncertainty**
Python project created to check the uncertainty estimation of ECG arrhythmias from the MIT-BIH dataset.**

This project started in June 2022 and ended in March 2023. Two versions of this project were done during this time, one where I trained and tested data using Tensorflow Keras, and one where I used PyTorch. I completed this study under the mentorship of a Ph.D. student at Duke University during my senior year of high school.

The purpose of this study was to give a more complete interpretation of electrocardiograms by finding uncertainty estimations of Deep Neural Network (DNN) definitions through various estimation methods. The overall objective of this project was to implement several different estimation methods on the MIT-BIH dataset. Afterward, I evaluated the error rate reduction after applying uncertainty estimation.

I created this repository in order to document my learning progress in programming over the course of this study.
